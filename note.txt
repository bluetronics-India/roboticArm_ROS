Robot Modelling and Control (Wiley):
	page 17: control the path: most advanced - our goal
	page 21: a robot is only as good as its hand or end-effector
Commands to manually control the joints:
	roscore
	rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
	rostopic pub --once /arm/elbow1_1_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 0.7
	OR
	rostopic pub pub1 arm_control/servo "{first: 15, second: 180, third: 0, forth: 0, fifth: 90}"
	OR
	rosrun arm_control pub1
RDS3115:
	scale 0-132 degrees == 0-180 degrees of normal servo
Arm servo init angles:
	elbow1_1: 0
	elbow1_2: 180
	elbow2_1: 0
	elbow2_2: 0

change the image of kinematic model can efficiently reduce work. for example to move from Origin 2 to Origin 5? really? can it? double check

1 motor was killed because of dust inside the servo. Be careful

the hardware design has some flaws:
	decrease workspace because of the position of the joint between servo and the cover (cant get right down)
	collision between th ecovers: may case damage
