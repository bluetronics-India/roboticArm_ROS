#LaTeX document class for bachelor and master theses written at the Institute for Web Science and Technologies
The document class "WeSTthesis.cls" is based on "cgBA.cls" which was provided by the [Research Group Mueller](http://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/koblenz/fb4/institute/icv/agmueller). It is oriented at the style guides provided by the examination board of the [Faculty of Computer Science](http://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/campus-koblenz/fb4) at the [University of Koblenz-Landau](http://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/). The document class provides a cover page template, a statement on source usage and publication, and some basic text formatting. The file [example.tex](example.tex) contains some of the most important LaTeX packages for writing a bachelor or master thesis.

#Usage
The following command is used to include the document class in the .tex document.

If the option `twoside` is activated, there are blank pages inserted after the cover page and its following statement(s).

	  \selectlanguage{english}  % optional: change document language from ngerman to english
