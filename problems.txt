1. rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py doesn't make new libraries in Arduino's sketchbook.
	Solution: rm -rf ros_lib inside sketchbook/libraries, run the command again
2. rosbuild_add_executable() doesn't work:
	Solution: Replace by	add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
				target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
				add_dependencies(talker ros_tut_generate_messages_cpp)
	(change talker with your cpp file name)
3. Cannot install ROS by apt-get:
	Solution: Download and use aptitude to install ros-ROSVERSION-desktop-full with dependencies taken care of.
4. Cannot run rosbuild commands:
	Solution: Working with ROS indigo or newer, users must use catkin. Read how to migrate to indigo here: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild
5. shaking inside gazebo: not enough initial param
6. Need to assemble the servos so that their initial position (in the middle of the workspace) should be 90 degrees, because you cannot input a minus degree into servo, we need to be able to reach the farthest point in the negative side of the servo.
7. Cannot upload to the Arduino, because serial_node.py (see more in note.txt, use this to connect ros to arduino) is running. Unplug the USB cable, re-plug, and upload. Sometimes you must change ACM0 to ACM1.
8. Gets the error "multiple definition" while including a .h file.
	Solution: not yet found
