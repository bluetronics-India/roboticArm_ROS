1. rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py doesn't make new libraries in Arduino's sketchbook.
	Solution: rm -rf ros_lib inside sketchbook/libraries, run the command again
2. rosbuild_add_executable() doesn't work:
	Solution: Replace by	add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
				target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
				add_dependencies(talker ros_tut_generate_messages_cpp)
	(change talker with your cpp file name)
